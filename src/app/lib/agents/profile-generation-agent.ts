CONVERSATION METRICS:
- Total messages: ${conversationMetrics.totalMessages}
- User messages: ${conversationMetrics.userMessages}
- Average message length: ${Math.round(conversationMetrics.averageLength)} characters
- Language used: ${language}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ${structuredAnswers ? "PRIORITIZE the structured onboarding answers above - they are the MOST EXPLICIT and USER-PROVIDED responses" : "Extract EXPLICIT information mentioned in the conversation"}
2. ${structuredAnswers ? "The EDUCATION LEVEL field is explicitly provided - use it EXACTLY for educationLevel and currentStatus fields" : "Infer REASONABLE conclusions based on context and conversation patterns"}
3. Use null/empty arrays for truly unknown information
4. Be specific and detailed - capture nuances and context
5. Consider Hawaii-specific factors (island location, local culture, etc.)
6. IMPORTANT: Write the summary in ENGLISH regardless of conversation language
7. CRITICAL: For educationLevel field, if EDUCATION LEVEL is provided in structured answers, map it as follows:
   - "high school" or mentions grade → "high_school"
   - "college - freshman" → "college_freshman"
   - "college - sophomore" → "college_sophomore"
   - "college - junior" → "college_junior"
   - "college - senior" → "college_senior"
   - "graduate student" or mentions masters/phd → "graduate"
   - "working professional" or mentions current job → "working_professional"
   - "career changer" → "working_professional"
8. ${structuredAnswers ? "Map the SKILLS mentioned to specific technical or soft skills" : "Extract skills from context"}
9. ${structuredAnswers ? "Use the DESIRED CAREER to inform careerGoals accurately" : "Identify career goals from conversation"}
10. ${structuredAnswers ? "If user mentions 'Junior [role]' seeking 'Senior [role]', set educationLevel to 'working_professional' and experienceLevel to 'experienced'" : "Infer experience from conversation"}

HOW TO REFER TO THE PERSON IN THE SUMMARY:
- If currently in school (K-12 or college): "the student"
- If working professional exploring options: "the professional" or "the individual"
- If career changer: "the career changer" or "the individual"
- If unemployed/job seeking: "the job seeker" or "the individual"
- If recent graduate: "the recent graduate"
- If returning to workforce: "the individual returning to the workforce"
- If status unclear: "the individual" (safe default)
- NEVER assume "student" unless they are actually currently enrolled in school

${structuredAnswers ? `
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR STRUCTURED DATA:
- INTERESTS: Parse "${structuredAnswers.interests}" into specific fields
- SKILLS: Parse "${structuredAnswers.skills}" - categorize into technical skills (coding, programming languages) and soft skills (communication, leadership)
- EXPERIENCES: "${structuredAnswers.experiences}" - use this to determine experienceLevel
- EDUCATION LEVEL: "${structuredAnswers.educationLevel}" - THIS IS EXPLICITLY PROVIDED. Map it to educationLevel enum EXACTLY:
  * If contains "high school" → "high_school"
  * If contains "freshman" → "college_freshman"
  * If contains "sophomore" → "college_sophomore"
  * If contains "junior" (referring to school year) → "college_junior"
  * If contains "senior" (referring to school year) → "college_senior"
  * If contains "graduate" or "masters" or "phd" → "graduate"
  * If contains "working" or "professional" or mentions current employment → "working_professional"
  * If contains "career changer" → "working_professional"
- DESIRED CAREER: "${structuredAnswers.careerTrack}" - This should DIRECTLY inform the careerGoals array
- IMPORTANT: If EXPERIENCES mentions "Junior [job]" seeking "Senior [job]", this means:
  * educationLevel = "working_professional"
  * experienceLevel = "experienced" (NOT "entry_level")
  * currentStatus = "employed"
` : ""}

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format. 

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ENUM FIELDS:
- For fields like "educationLevel", "currentStatus", "timeline", "location", etc.
- You MUST choose EXACTLY ONE value from the options provided
- Return ONLY the chosen value as a string (e.g., "college_junior")
- DO NOT return multiple values separated by | or any other delimiter
- DO NOT return the entire list of options
- Choose the MOST ACCURATE option based on the conversation
- Use "null" only if truly unknown

EXAMPLE:
✅ CORRECT: "educationLevel": "college_junior"
❌ WRONG: "educationLevel": "college_freshman|college_sophomore|college_junior"
❌ WRONG: "educationLevel": "college_freshman OR college_sophomore"

SUMMARY WRITING EXAMPLES:
✓ CORRECT: "The individual is a working professional in healthcare looking to transition into nursing..."
✓ CORRECT: "The high school junior is interested in marine biology and wants to attend UH Mānoa..."
✓ CORRECT: "The career changer has 10 years in retail and is exploring opportunities in IT..."
✗ INCORRECT: "The student is a working professional..." (contradictory - choose one)
✗ INCORRECT: "The student has been unemployed for 6 months..." (they're not a student)

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Extract specific details, not just generic categories
- If someone mentions "helping people" also note the specific context (healthcare, teaching, social work, etc.)
- Pay attention to Hawaiian context - island preferences, local culture, family expectations
- Capture both stated goals and implied interests
- Note any concerns, fears, or excitement expressed
- Consider their communication style and engagement level
- Be honest about confidence levels - don't inflate scores
- If exploring careers, that IS a valid career goal - capture it as such
- The summary MUST be in English as plain text without any formatting
- USE THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY - respect who the person actually is`;
